        So far, I've learnt the Hyper text markup language <b>(HTML)</b> and <b>CSS</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>CSS makes the front-end of a website</i> <b>shine and it creates a great user experience</b>. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, <b>CSS is responsible for font color, padding, border, margin, outline, etc.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
CSS also controls the fonts, text, colors, backgrounds, and the layout.

      <!-- Third section -->
      </h2>
      <p>In CSS, a <i>margin</i> is the space <b>around</b> an element's border</b>, while <i>padding</i> is the space <b>between</b> an element's border and the element's content. Put another way, <b>the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.</b></p>
      
<p><i>A border</i>  <b>goes around the padding and content.</b>  <i>A 
 margin </i><b>clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.</b>
<p>
  <i>
Use a margin when you want to adjust the spacing of an element and use padding when you want to adjust the appearance of the element itself. Margins aren't a part of the element; padding is.
